experiment w/ persistant disk based
state.

very rough, feeling it out

scrape (inefficiently right now) tumblr blog
and post images to callback

docker run --restart="always" -d -p 8080:80 -v /persistant/place/:/data --name="skyscraper" rranshous/skyscraper

using a docker container as data storage is recommended so that you can update hte skyscraper image and restart the app but not lose the data
